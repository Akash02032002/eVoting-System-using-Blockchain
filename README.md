In this my Final Year Major project, we introduced a blockchain-based electronic voting system that utilizes 
smart contracts to enable secure and cost-efficient election while guaranteeing voters 
privacy. Blockchain technology offers a new possibility to overcome the limitations 
and adoption barriers of electronic voting systems which ensures the election security 
and integrity and lays the ground for transparency. Using an Ethereum private 
blockchain, it is possible to send hundreds of transactions per second onto the 
blockchain, utilizing every aspect of the smart contract to ease the load on the 
blockchain. To achieve this we have divided this overall work into three modules. 
1. The front-end module 
2. The back-end module 
3. Connection of two different module along with the testing.

Until now we have completed our first module, in which we created the interactive user
interface for the admin as well as the user. We have also done some research work 
related to the implementation of Blockchain in decentralized application. 
And In the future to make the voting process more secure and to correctly identify the 
person who is voting we can use ML and AI concepts. Using these concepts we can 
verify whether the person voting is the same as the person who has registered during 
the registration process.
